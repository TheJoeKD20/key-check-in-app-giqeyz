You want to create a simple check-in/check-out system for client site keys, with the ability to add new keys and record the person checking out the key.

You can:\n- Add keys to the system\n- Check out keys to people\n- Check in keys when they're returned\n- Track all key activity\n- See real-time statistics on your dashboard\n\nAll data is stored locally on the device, so no backend setup is required.

When you check out or check in a key, the app saves the data to AsyncStorage\n2. After the success alert, it navigates to the home screen using `router.replace('/')`\n3. The home screen's `useFocusEffect` hook detects that the screen has come into focus\n4. It automatically calls `loadKeys()` to refresh all the statistics and recent activity\n5. You'll see the updated counts and status immediately\n\nThe combination of `router.replace('/')` and `useFocusEffect` ensures that:\n- The home screen is always showing the latest data\n- The navigation stack is clean (replace instead of push)\n- The refresh happens automatically without any manual intervention\n\nYour check-in/check-out buttons will now refresh the data and take you back to the home screen as requested!"}, {"type": "lint", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "build", "build_type": "build", "status": "complete", "success": true}, {"type": "commit", "commit_id": "46ad103ddbc26827af01b48d9de54f26c5a96006", "message": "feat: Refresh home screen on focus after check-in/check-out", "timestamp": "2025-10-31T14:42:23Z", "files_changed": ["app/(tabs)/(home)/check-out.tsx", "app/(tabs)/(home)/check-in.tsx", "app/(tabs)/(home)/index.tsx"], "update_number": 4, "parent_commit_id": "545101ebb0ff4ba14fca901eb3c58de98485d854"}], "timestamp": "2025-10-31T14:38:51Z"}]
